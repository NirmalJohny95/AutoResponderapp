# AutoResponderapp
------------------------

The project “Assistant App” provides an effective way to leave phone ‘mute’ in unavoidable situations like meeting, classes etc and to get notified only for the emergency cases. The project has an android application. The user can install the android application on an android phone with minimum system requirements demanded by the app. The application can be activated to respond to phone calls or messages or both. App auto responds to the contacting person and reads the reply from the contacting person to detect emergency to ignore or notify user. The project provides automation in the field of communication.


It responds to the notifications approaching the phone. The system focus is to respond to the notifications as per user situations which is pre-set by the user. The project has immense scope in the field of social life.
Users can also see a log of call notifications while the mode is enabled. The application comes with smart reply which can be activated to send auto-SMS with an estimate of when the user is likely to be available for a call. 


The proposed project is an assistant app which works as a background service for the android smart phone. The app facilitates services to auto respond to the notifications (Calls, Messages), like auto replying as per the user situations. In case of urgency, the user will be notified or else avoided. The mode will be set to the app before getting into the situation, thus the background app service itself controls the phone to behave as per the mode.


Later the app can detect reply from the contacting person to determine whether the call or message is urgent.This is done by setting with the message that we have already preset within the app.If the contacting person is so urgent to contact the user the contacting person can contact the person by reply the user by sending a message yes so that the app which is installed in the users phone detect this message as the background service of this is running behind this app detects this message which is received from the contacting person. In order to notify the user about this call which is being received from the contacting person the message which is received from the contacting person is then used to interrupt the phone by making the phone to vibrate as per it is set in the app.
